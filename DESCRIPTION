Description: Provides functions to estimate models for mixed models using, for 
    instance, pedigree data like in <10.1002/sim.1603>. The approximation is 
    based on direct log marginal likelihood approximations like the randomized 
    Quasi-Monte Carlo suggested by <10.1198/106186002394> with a similar 
    procedure to approximate the derivatives.
